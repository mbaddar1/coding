edge cases
1- empty array
2- all array values are equal 11111111
3- if else cases all to be covered
4- dont forget to return something
5- sort the array and use it! may be safer to sort in place arr = sorted(arr)
6- review assumptions THOROUGHLY PLEASE !! for ex. are input arrays sorted
7-do we need if or it is a repeated process, while with maybe a break ?
8-with while , for i a) dont forget update value b) check boundaries with short circuit op, it's a free running index





Good examples for quick review
1- Revenue Milestones
2-pow(x,n) # deep recursive, see the first attempt WRONG solution
3- BinSearch - while i<=j not i<j, corner cases of sorted arrays
4-
